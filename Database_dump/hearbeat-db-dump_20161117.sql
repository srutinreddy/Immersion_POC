11	81	10	t	I have all positive things to say. Anne has ramped up very quickly on the project, asks excellent clarifying questions and proactively offers valuable suggestions. She takes the time to understand first and then implements solutions that surpass expectations and are aligned with business needs. Matt, well, what can I say? Huggie is one of a kind. Matt demonstrates professionalism, patience and development leadership at all times. He is an excellent developer that cares about our businesses, the quality of the work delivered and overall team performance. I know with Matt leading the way that our business is in good hands. I have a great deal of confidence in his technical insight and ability to guide the team. 	2015-01-27 15:31:51.997769	2015-01-27 15:31:51.997769

17	87	8	t	Overall we've been super happy. The only thing that has been hard is learning on Monday that we need to add 2 weeks to development (and budget) to hit the milestones we set -- milestones that we continually revisited to make sure we were on target for. Our team understands that you can only estimate the level of effort and time a project will take, but that was hard to hear after so long of "being on target". \r\n\r\nOn another note, I want to again express my gratitude for QL being willing to work with us on our payment terms and schedule. I know you guys have bills to pay and we want to be able to pay on time. While I know this will happen, I still want to express how helpful that has been. \r\n\r\nThanks!	2015-03-26 21:36:14.577171	2015-03-26 21:36:14.577171

20	98	10	t	Main feedback I have is I continue to want to push the envelope on this new design.  So don't be afraid to send us ideas that are outside of what we have been discussing or thinking. Maybe just things to get us thinking differently.  As I have discussed, I do not want to build the same thing again.  So I want to make sure our new design reflects a new application, but still provides our users with all the functionality they have today.  Just looks and behaves much better than it has in the past.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your hard work!!!	2015-04-15 17:56:48.991027	2015-04-15 17:56:48.991027
21	44	6	t	Since Laura has left Teal Team, Alex has been struggling with too much refactoring. His hesitance to let a story be marked complete has slowed the team down. His code is beautiful before he refactors. The team and I have talked to him about this, but I feel he could use a little encouragement from his QuickLeft mentors as well.\r\n\r\nTony's been doing great, but doing a lot of hidden work. I've asked him to bring this work forward to the team in the form of engineering user stories. This work is important to highlight because it shows the true cost of our engineering efforts. Also, Tony should get credit for all he's doing.	2015-04-22 15:19:50.375801	2015-04-22 15:19:50.375801

29	113	9	t	The one bit of feedback is about Milan. \r\n\r\nLast week he wasn't raising his hand enough with challenges on the oAuth tickets. It resulted in our ATD (Jeremy) having to rewrite the functionality over the weekend.\r\n\r\nWe've made some changes in the team communication structure that appears to have solved this issue.\r\n\r\nFlora has been an absolute delight!	2015-06-10 21:24:09.964331	2015-06-10 21:24:09.964331

109	129	7	t	I like the culture and fit for the engagement thus far. Team is knowledgeable and personable, and effective communicators. \r\n\r\nI would say my main recommendation for improvement would to be to drive the engagement vs asking the client to drive. I hired QL as the experts, and as such QL should come in with a standard process, line of questioning, and game plan to deliver. The exploratory phase was a bit ad hoc, and unstructured. A little more framing or structure would have improved efficiency and confidence.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing how the engagement progresses.	2015-08-07 13:00:04.838216	2015-08-07 13:00:04.838216

Your team is well trained and executes.  \r\n\r\nThe decision structure is still unclear to me, though we're admittedly early in the process.  I was surprised by Ben asking about parts of the site they can ignore.  I thought this would be apparent after writing the user stories.  Ben countered with a chicken/egg scenario in which either could come first.  I understand the logic, but it caught me a little off guard when I think back to the description of the user stories in the kickoff meeting.  I want to be prepared and didn't feel so then.\r\n\r\nI suppose I need to see the process of writing the stories to better understand my role vice QL.  \r\n\r\nAll told, I'm excited by the process and the product.	2015-09-03 12:23:47.972494	2015-09-03 12:23:47.972494

252	136	8	t	Hard to say too much, as we're only getting stated.  We did greatly appreciate the flexibility snd understanding in changing dates last minute when one of our team had family emergency. Think it was a good start, with a lot of "data dump" in relatively short time period - and from a fair number of people. Good that this did not seem to phase the team too much. I think the one thing I would include as an "opportunity for improvement" was that it did not seem as if the team had done as much "homework" on who we are/what the site does currently. Not sure if this is the norm before a discovery sprint, but did feel like we came in almost came in cold and this may have made the 2 days a bit less efficient.

255	136	10	t	The Discovery Sprint that QL led was very helpful and appropriate; thank you!\r\nChris did a great job of adapting the "usual thing" to our specific situation; again, thank you!\r\n\r\nI missed the "fun part" of blue-sky brainstorming; and, truth be told, it probably was more important to communicate the established team's understandings and needs that we had already identified over the past couple years of working on this stuff. \r\n\r\nAll of us are really looking forward to working with all of you (until we all know to the marrow of our bones that "you" are in fact part of the "us." :-)	2015-11-12 19:18:01.201505	2015-11-12 19:18:01.201505

262	44	10	t	Kudos to Anne for being very proactive this last sprint.  She took the time to add benchmarks which identified a clear bottleneck in our code.  Likewise she independently added metrics to one of our jobs, increasing visibility and improving our product.  I greatly appreciate her drive.\r\n\r\nLikewise I want to note that Mike helped complete a challenging and important story this last sprint.  He did a good job starting conversations, evaluating solutions, and standing his ground for approaches that made sense to him.  That kind of collaboration and leadership is very helpful.  I'm glad to have him on the team.	2015-11-18 03:02:28.876787	2015-11-18 03:02:28.876787

They provide good feedback about the specs, do the work in a timely manner (I don't think they have ever missed a target date) and fix bugs when needed. And Phuong does a great job of communicating and letting me know where we stand with the number of hours remaining on our task orders. I really appreciate everyone's effort on this project.

285	99	10	t	I think Rich Brown already responded to this survey, but I just wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the work that Piper has been doing on this project. Without his help, we would not be able to deliver our new "Label" feature for our December SEED release. Piper has worked steadily and efficiently on this and we are about finished with it, and it looks like we will meet our December deadline.

286	107	10	t	Personally, I'm sad to see Marc go.  He was wonderful to work with and the next client he works with will be lucky to have him.  Michael has also been great to work with and as usual he's continuing to produce high quality work.	2015-12-10 00:01:27.544682	2015-12-10 00:01:27.544682

He's been a huge asset to us over the last month+ (I've only been here that long, but can only assume he's been equally as awesome his whole time here). \r\n\r\nSpecifically, in the last few weeks, he's been aggressive about looking for stories to work on, which has been great. He's offered to help out wherever he can and all in all, has been a really valuable teammate. We will definitely miss his contributions going forward but are excited for him and whatever he works on next!\r\n\r\np.s. Sorry I missed the last survey, but it would have been equally as enthusiastic and grateful. We will miss Randall a lot on our team!	2015-12-17 17:37:15.210711	2015-12-17 17:37:15.210711

It is turning out very nicely and Piper's contributions have been wonderful. Also, he participated heavily in our monthly software developer call, which was great ! He is a very valuable contributor to our SEED project, and might turn out to be our most important developer ! So I (we) REALLY appreciate having him on our team.

326	148	7	t	Keri has been a great addition to our team.  She's primarily been pairing with one of our junior level developers, focusing primarily on modular HTML and CSS buildout.  Their work is part of an aggressive burn-down of technical debt.  Keri has done a great job taking and learning from feedback.  I've seen a quick correction of patterns we're trying to avoid, which is great.  \r\n\r\nThe one area I'd like to see improvement on is the validation of work and the impact of that work prior to opening a pull request. Pull requests are great for viewing design approach and functional changes, but can hard to visually detect regression bugs.  With the high rate of change, we don't have solid automated tests in place to catch these types of regression issues.  I'd like to see Keri take the time to test all features/changes locally prior to pushing changes.  The speed of work completed has been solid, and I'd prefer she move a little slower and verify locally all code works as desired.	2016-01-22 17:45:08.651304	2016-01-22 17:45:08.651304

349	99	10	t	As usual, Nick and Piper have been making great progress fixing bugs and implementing new features. As well as getting us set up with better diagnostic tools (Sentry). They are great collaborators and are a wonderful asset to the SEED development team. And Jenna helped guide us toward front loading their time before the code freeze (coming up next week) which was extremely helpful. Thanks to all of you, it is really great working with you !! 	2016-02-11 00:35:58.460633	2016-02-11 00:35:58.460633

Your structured approach and democratic processes are important to maintain the free flow of ideas, especially from your team, and to keep both teams on point.

Also raised some questions around the algorithm and filtering -- the answer was basically that Mindy thinks there's stuff we're doing, but we think she's in charge of doing those things. I will address those things at our meeting today, but already alerted that conflict with Britt.	I don't feel like this project is going well (see blockers above), and not sure how to get it to a better place. I'm not happy with the code we're writing, I'm not happy with our velocity/progress, and I'm feeling daunted by the amount of work we have to do to get them to their end of March release.	yellow	65325	313500	dollars	20	f		t		\N	weeks

On Tuesday after the team's retrospective, the SEM (Jeff Sutherland) came in and announced that the team was failing at communicating with other teams (e.g., ops, architecture). He told them that because of this, he was hiring a Team Lead for them. They were shocked to be told that they weren't communicating well (they've been very proactive at setting up meetings with architecture and keeping things rolling with ops, without external prodding), and upset that they weren't given a chance to improve things. SEM was not willing to discuss alternatives -- his decision had been made.

157	4		From my last client check-in:\r\n\r\nThere's currently one blocker that I might need your help with. I emailed Travis last week but haven't heard back from him yet. We need a way to being able to access the media that's uploaded for visual rounds. This should be pretty straightforward, since we've confirmed that those uploads are persisted on motherbrain. This could easily be a 15 minute code change for either Travis or Mike to make. Some assistance greasing the wheels on this will be really helpful for being able to finish off visual rounds for tablets.\r\n\r\nThe one other outstanding issue is the long-term concern for having data persistently sync'ed between motherbrain and our application(s). Travis and I had talked through a few strategies for how best to do this, but I need to confirm with him which route we end up taking. This doesn't affect our ability to run a QA session with recent data, but it will be a necessary step before any QA that Quick Left isn't directly involved with.	2013-10-07 18:26:48.840577	2013-10-07 18:26:48.840577	6	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	weeks

Based on our stand up this morning, Alex is having to re-write the carousel for the 3rd time. I know that we don't have too much control over this and that it's moot if we are going to switch the types of project that we work on, but I think it would be a good idea for us in the future to a) do the discovery with the client and b) to work more directly with the client. I think a lot gets lost when we're working with this weird third party in between us and the client. From what I understand this is the first time that Walmart is seeing the carousel and it was written quite a while ago.

None.	2016-10-31 15:05:48.397114	2016-10-31 15:05:48.397114	185	3	f	Everyday	\N	Talking.	Found out more about the engagement before I showed up.	f			green	\N	\N	\N	\N	t		t		\N	weeks
1537	4	Good, and TBD	Demo is today, but we haven't received confirmation that our app has successfully been deployed in Kaiser's environment.	2016-10-31 15:22:55.880438	2016-10-31 15:22:55.880438	181	4	f	Everyday	\N	Clearly laying out what was left, discussing our thoughts for implementation, and dividing up the tasks.	Nothing.	f			green	\N	\N	\N	0	f		t		\N	weeks
1541	3	I think the client is feeling okay. They are delivering by EOD tomorrow (hopefully) and I think we're in pretty good shape for that.	No blockers.	2016-10-31 16:45:18.749083	2016-10-31 16:45:18.749083	174	3	f	Everyday	\N	Alex has learned a lot about different ways to write carousels. jQuery UI might never be the right option. I've also been learning a lot about SVGs	We are really feeling the pain of tech debt recently. The code base is a mess so everything we touch seems to break something else. I think it would have helped to push a little harder at the beginning of the project towards using angular or something more structured to at least keep files in a more organized manner.	f			green	\N	\N	\N	0	f		t		\N	weeks
1542	4	Very good about project direction and staying ahead of the curve.	None	2016-10-31 17:40:08.2237	2016-10-31 17:40:08.2237	179	4	f	Everyday	\N	Lisa was able to quickly deliver fleshed out designs and integrate feedback. Abraham worked hard to get the devops configurations and servers set up. Phuong and Irene went to bat for the team again and again to get information, give feedback, and prevent blockers. Morgan built a style guide and assisted with information gathering for authentication guidelines.	Spent more time cross training on devops that Abraham is setting up. Will be doing that this week.	t			green	\N	\N	\N	6	f		t		\N	weeks
1543	4	Internal stakeholders seem to be doing fine. We have a demo scheduled for Monday 11/7 that will be a more targeted pulse check but no one has voiced concerns.	We do not have blockers but we do have a lot of concern from the dev team on achieving MVP in time with all the required dependencies and moving pieces nailed down.	2016-11-07 17:49:49.890632	2016-11-07 17:49:49.890632	179	3	t	Everyday	\N	Phuong, Irene, and Chris stepped up to help manage communications with Cognizant internal teams re: SAML, configuration, finding answers for auditing, etc.	Worked more closely with Nick and Abraham on the needs/todos for DevOps and SAML/backend config.	t		I need help from the stakeholder team on addressing dependencies and getting questions answered from the other Cognizant teams. I may need 1 or 2 developers to help swarm on tasks this week but need to evaluate if it would be too many cooks in the kitchen first.	yellow	\N	\N	\N	4	f		t		\N	weeks

1545	3	Same ol. Happy with our progress. Waiting on stuff on the back end.	Still waiting for VPN access. This has pretty high suck factor, as we still haven't hit an API.	2016-11-07 20:17:45.927482	2016-11-07 20:17:45.927482	175	3	t	Everyday	\N	Time boxing IE troubleshooting. Strategic pairing.
